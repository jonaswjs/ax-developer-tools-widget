If no\n * replacement for a key exists, the placeholder will simply not be substituted.\n *\n * Some examples:\n * ```javascript\n * string.format( 'Hello [0], how do you like [1]?', [ 'Peter', 'Cheeseburgers' ] );\n * // => 'Hello Peter, how do you like Cheeseburgers?'\n * ```\n * ```javascript\n * string.format( 'Hello [name] and [partner], how do you like [0]?', [ 'Pizza' ], {\n *    name: 'Hans',\n *    partner: 'Roswita'\n * } );\n * // => 'Hello Hans and Roswita, how do you like Pizza?'\n * ```\n * If a pair of brackets should not be treated as a placeholder, the opening bracket can simply be escaped\n * by backslashes (thus to get an actual backslash in a JavaScript string literal, which is then treated as\n * an escape symbol, it needs to be written as double backslash):\n * ```javascript\n * string.format( 'A [something] should eventually only have \\\\[x].', {\n *    something: 'checklist'\n * } );\n * // => 'A checklist should eventually only have [x].'\n * ```\n * A placeholder key can be any character string besides `[`, `]` and `:` to keep parsing simple and fast.\n * By using `:` as separator it is possible to provide a type specifier for string serialization or other\n * additional mapping functions for the value to insert. Type specifiers always begin with an `%` and end\n * with the specifier type. Builtin specifiers and their according formatter functions are defined\n * as {@link DEFAULT_FORMATTERS}.\n *\n * When no specifier is provided, by default `%s` is assumed.\n *\n * Example:\n * ```javascript\n * string.format( 'Hello [0:%s], you owe me [1:%.2f] euros.', [ 'Peter', 12.1243 ] );\n * // => 'Hello Peter, you owe me 12.12 euros.'\n * ```\n *\n * Mapping functions should instead consist of simple strings and may not begin with a `%` character. It is\n * advised to use the same naming rules as for simple JavaScript functions. Type specifiers and mapping\n * functions are applied in the order they appear within the placeholder.\n *\n * An example, where we assume that the mapping functions `flip` and `double` where defined by the user\n * when creating the `formatString` function using {@link #createFormatter()}:\n * ```javascript\n * formatString( 'Hello [0:%s:flip], you owe me [1:double:%.2f] euros.', [ 'Peter', 12 ] );\n * // => 'Hello reteP, you owe me 24.00 euros.'\n * ```\n *\n * Note that there currently exist no builtin mapping functions.\n *\n * If a type specifier is used that doesn't exist, an exception is thrown. In contrast to that the use of\n * an unknown mapping function results in a no-op.

If the first argument is\n * omitted or `null`, the default formatters for type specifiers are used. Otherwise only the provided map\n * of specifiers is available to the returned format function. Each key of the map is a specifier character\n * where the `%` is omitted and the value is the formatting function. A formatting function receives the\n * value to format (i.e. serialize) and the sub-specifier (if any) as arguments. For example for the format\n * specifier `%.2f` the sub-specifier would be `.2` where for `%s` it would simply be the empty string.\n *\n * Example:\n * ```js\n * const format = string.createFormatter( {\n *    'm': function( value ) {\n *       return value.amount + ' ' + value.currency;\n *    },\n *    'p': function( value, subSpecifier ) {\n *       return Math.pow( value, parseInt( subSpecifier, 10 ) );\n *    }\n * } );\n *\n * format( 'You owe me [0:%m].', [ { amount: 12, currency: 'EUR' } ] );\n * // => 'You owe me 12 EUR.'\n *\n * format( '[0]^3 = [0:%3p]', [ 2 ] );\n * // => '2^3 = 8'\n * ```\n *\n * The second argument is completely additional to the behavior of the default {@link #format()}\n * function. Here a map from mapping function id to actual mapping function can be passed in. Whenever the\n * id of a mapping function is found within the placeholder, that mapping function is called with the\n * current value and its return value is either passed to the next mapping function or rendered\n * instead of the placeholder if there are no more mapping function ids or type specifiers within the\n * placeholder string.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * const format = string.createFormatter( null, {\n *    flip: function( value ) {\n *       return ( '' + s ).split( '' ).reverse().join( '' );\n *    },\n *    double: function( value ) {\n *       return value * 2;\n *    }\n * } );\n *\n * format( 'Hello [0:%s:flip], you owe me [1:double:%.2f] euros.', [ 'Peter', 12 ] );\n * // => 'Hello reteP, you owe me 24.00 euros.'\n * ```\n *\n * @param {Object} typeFormatters\n *    map from format specifier (single letter without leading `%`) to formatting function\n * @param {Object} [optionalValueMappers]\n *    map from mapping identifier to mapping function\n *\n * @return {Function}\n *    a function having the same api as {@link #format()}\n */\nfunction createFormatter() {\n   var typeFormatters = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !==

A listens to event b and B listens to event a.\n * Whenever A publishes a and B than instantly (i.e. in the same event cycle of the JavaScript runtime\n * where its subscriber function was called) *responds* by publishing b, b arrives at the subscriber\n * function of A, before the promise of A's publish action is resolved.\n * It is hence possible to observe possible effects of an event sent by oneself, under the conditions\n * mentioned above.

This pattern has\n * evolved over time and is of great use when handling the asynchronous nature of event bus events.\n *\n * Certain rules need to be fulfilled: First the initiator needs to call this method with an event whose\n * name has the suffix `Request`, e.g. `takeActionRequest`. All collaborators that want to react to this\n * event then either do so in the same event cycle by sending a `didTakeAction` event or announce that they\n * will do something asynchronously by publishing a `willTakeAction` event. In the latter case they need to\n * broadcast the fulfillment of their action some time later by sending a `didTakeAction` event. Note that for\n * both events the same sender name needs to be given. Otherwise they cannot be mapped and the event bus\n * doesn't know if all asynchronous replies were already received.\n *\n * Additionally a timer is started using either the globally configured `pendingDidTimeout` ms value or the\n * value provided as option to this method. If that timer expires before all `did*` events to all given\n * `will*` events were received, the error handler is called to handle the incident and the promise is\n * rejected with all responses received up to now.\n *\n * @param {String} eventName\n *    the name of the event to publish\n * @param {Object} [optionalEvent]\n *    the event to publish\n * @param {Object} [optionalOptions]\n *    additional options for the publish action\n * @param {String} [optionalOptions.sender=null]\n *    the id of the event sender.
